## Andrew features

### Core CiviCRM

- **[dev/accessibility#4](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/accessibility/issues/4)
  Make alerts accessible
  ([12158](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12158))**

  A new setting allows a site administrator to disable the automatic
  disappearance of alerts.

  In addition, alerts are denoted so that screen readers can provide audible
  notice.

- **Permit UI editing of custom data on other entities (here relationship_type)
  when enabled in an extension
  ([12128](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12128))**

- **Upgrade Smarty to 2.6.31 to solve issues on PHP7.2
  ([208](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-packages/pull/208))**

  The Smarty templating engine has been updated.

- **ApiExplorer - Output short array syntax
  ([12108](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12108))**

  The API explorer now produces array syntax using square brackets rather than
  `array()`.

- **Extend fiscal year relative options to better match other periods
  ([12137](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12137))**

  Filters for fiscal year can now handle relative dates for previous single and
  multiple fiscal years.

- **Adjust creation of markup for Open Flash Chart
  ([11951](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11951))**

  This avoids problems that can be triggered in certain environments by the
  `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<title>` elements coming in a row within the chart
  markup.

- **Change custom contact ref groups selector to use select2
  ([12234](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12234))**

  The groups selector for limiting the contacts available to a contact reference
  custom field now uses a Select2 widget rather than a multiple-select element.

### CiviCase

- **Add inplace edit for timeline name
  ([12000](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12000))**

  The name of a case type timeline can now be edited from within the tab header
  of the timeline editing screen.

### CiviContribute

- **[dev/financial#12](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/12) move
  soft credit item count to an object property so it can be modified via hook
  ([12011](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12011))**

  This makes it simpler for an extension to modify the hard-coded number of rows
  available for recording soft credits on a contribution.

### CiviMember

- **[dev/core#38](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/38) Recurring
  Contribution Information on Membership Modal
  ([11903](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11903) and
  [12203](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12203)**

  When viewing the details of a contact's membership, you can now see
  information about any recurring contribution series that auto-renews the
  membership rather than just the payments themselves.

### Backdrop integration

- **Backdrop - update styles for status messages
  ([12227](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12227))**

### Drupal integration

- **[dev/drupal#17](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/drupal/issues/17) Drupal8: Get
  UF locale/language is not supported (ex: for inheritLocale)
  ([12139](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12139))**

  This adds support for inheriting a user's language from the CMS on a Drupal 8
  site.

## Andrew bugs

### Core CiviCRM

- **[CRM-21816](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21816) Relative dates
  in searches cause some other conditions to be ignored
  ([11737](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11737))**

- **[dev/core#43](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/43) Google geocoding
  now seems to require an API key, settings page text needs update
  ([12188](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12188))**

- **[dev/core#80](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/80)] Current Employer
  is not reset after relationship is updated
  ([12032](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12032))**

  Changing the relationship type for a current employer relationship would not
  remove the organization from being listed as the individual's current
  employer.

- **[CRM-20621](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20621) manage tags:
  the tag usage count is not accurate
  ([12256](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12256)) (preliminary
  work)**

- **[CRM-21853](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21853) Editing
  CustomGroup always sets is_multiple to false by default
  ([11877](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11877) and
  [12116](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12116))**

  When editing a custom data set in the API, the value of whether the set
  supports multiple values would be set to false when the `is_multiple`
  parameter was absent.  This is now resolved.

- **[dev/core#98](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/98) Searching by any
  Address fields with location type other than primary throw DB error
  ([12074](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12074))**

- **[dev/core#99](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/99) Search builder
  doesn't retain selected (boolean) option after searching
  ([12076](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12076))**

- **[CRM-20922](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-20922) Can't set
  default value via URL query string, for custom date fields
  ([11868](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11868))**

- **Fix e-notice ([12090](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12090))**

  This resolves a PHP notice that appears in some circumstances when a field
  does not specify a maximum length.

- **[dev/core#8](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/8) Fatal error on
  Print/Merge Document for Cases
  ([11936](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11936)) (completes prior
  work)**

- **Fix fatal error on logging tab when hook alters logging tables.
  ([12070](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12070))**

- **[dev/core#30](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/30) Exporting master
  address contact even if no master address contact is defined
  ([12004](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12004))**

- **Hide Adding Option Value for Locked Groups
  ([11962](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11962))**

  This resolves some places where it was possible to delete values for option
  groups that are locked.

- **dev/core#122 Wrong Action Links Shown for Reserved and Locked Option Groups
  ([12154](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12154))**

- **[dev/core#69](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/69)
  'state_province_name' token not working for alternate billing addresses
  ([12003](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12003))**

- **[CRM-21675](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21675) scheduled
  reminders: limit to group doesn't support smart groups
  ([11629](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11629))**

  Smart groups and child groups now work as expected when limiting the
  recipients of scheduled reminders.

- **[dev/core#131](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/131) Add in missing
  UK shire Monmouthshire
  ([12168](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12168))**

  The Welsh county of Monmouthshire was missing from `civicrm_state_province`.

- **[CRM-21776](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21776) DB Error when
  printing advanced search results sorted by custom field.
  ([11679](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11679))**

  fails when empty Cc and Bcc parameters are passed
  ([12036](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12036))**

- **[dev/core#116](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/116) Search builder
  searches on primary addresses are producing unexpected results
  ([12153](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12153))**

- **[dev/core#126](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/126) Soft Credit
  report redirect to Contribution Detail report doesn't filter contact id
  ([12172](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12172))**

  This resolves a regression in the basic report template where contact ID was
  no longer supported as a filter.

- **[dev/accessibility#3](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/accessibility/issues/3)
  Add aria-label (and label?) to form elements missing them
  ([11944](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11944) and
  [12208](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12208)) (partial work)**

  This consolidates CMS-specific templates for including the page header and
  footer elements in each page.  It also adds the `aria-label` attribute to the
  datepicker date and time fields.

- **More robust managed entity deletion
  ([12021](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12021))**

  This resolves certain situations where managed entities created by an
  extension could be left orphaned in the database even after the extension is
  uninstalled.

- **[dev/core#143](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/143) Contact 'World
  Region' Field not functioning properly in Search Builder
  ([12214](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12214))**

  Counties don't chain in Search Builder
  ([12213](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12213))**

- **[dev/core#155](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/155) Improvements and
  bugfixes to Option Groups UI
  ([12229](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12229)) (partially
  complete)**

  This resolves a bug where it was impossible to save an option value with a
  value of zero.

### CiviCase

- **[CRM-21598](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21598) Case Activity
  issues with custom Completed Status Type.
  ([11456](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11456))**

  Activities with custom statuses that have a "completed" status type were
  treated as incomplete in the display of case activities and the treatment of a
  case sequence.

### CiviContribute

- **[dev/core#35](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/35) avoid template
  variable leakage when processing more than one recurring contribution in a
  session ([12175](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12175))**

  Soft credits and other values for a recurring contribution would get picked up
  by recurring contributions processed later in the same process.

- **Payflow Pro not payflo
  ([12083](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12083))**

  This standardizes the spelling of "PayFlow Pro" in error messages and code
  comments.

- **[dev/core#105](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/105) Manage PCP URL
  Wrong for the notification email under wordpress
  ([12093](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12093))**

  campaign page would link to the front end in Joomla and WordPress sites.

  ([12156](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12156))**

- **[dev/financial#14](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/financial/issues/14) PayPal
  Express recurring payment causes warning messages
  ([12171](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12171)) (preliminary
  work)**

  unreliable getting payment processor type
  ([12174](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12174)) (preliminary
  work)**

- **[dev/core#139](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/139) Contribution
  Details Report throws DB error When trying to filter by soft_credit_type but
  not including soft credits
  ([12205](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12205))**

### CiviEvent

- **[dev/core#108](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/108) unable to create
  new event location without impacting other events
  ([12104](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12104))**

  for Event Participants' gives DB error if the price fields are disabled.
  ([12024](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12024)) (resolved for
  some situations)**

- **[dev/core#123](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/123) Import -
  Participant - Custom participant date fields are not formatted
  ([12159](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12159))**

### CiviMail

- **only add a closing quote if it is not already present
  ([12182](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12182))**

  This resolves a bug where CiviMail would add a quote character at the end of
  link URLs too aggressively.

### CiviMember

- **Removing related memberships if parent membership type is changed which does
  not have relation type associated.
  ([12180](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12180))**

  If you change a membership with inherited members to a type that does not
  allow inherited memberships, the inherited memberships are now completely
  deleted.

- **[CRM-21632](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-21632)
  {membership.fee} prints out in documents with 9 decimal places
  ([12196](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12196))**

- **[dev/core#100](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/100) Membership
  Detail report throw DB error
  ([12094](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/12094))**

  If ACLs are enabled, a fatal error would appear when running the membership
  detail report due to the ACLs being applied twice.

- **Support hooks for MembershipType entity
  ([11908](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/11908))**

  The `hook_civicrm_pre` and `hook_civicrm_post` hooks are now invoked when
  creating or editing a membership type.
